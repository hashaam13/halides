X-ray data analysis of proteins containing fluoride, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms were obtained from www.rcsb.org [1] using Biopython (module Bio.PDB) [2,3].  Entries with the best resolution were selected among the entries with the same COMPND 2 MOLECULE section in pdb file  using biopandas[4]. All files have a resolution of at least 2A. Pdb files obtained by NMR were excluded. Halogen neighbors were identified within 5A, the distance from halogen to neighbor was also determined using biopandas. If halogen had more than one neighbor, then the angles were determined between halogen-nearest atom vector and the halogen-atom vector using numpy[5]. The accessable surface area of each halogen was determined using freesasa [6]. If  pdb file contained many halide sites with identical geometry (the angle error for all neighbors of the halide does not exceed 3 degrees, the distance error does not exceed 0.5A), then only one representative was selected from such set.
