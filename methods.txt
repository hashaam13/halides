X-ray data analysis of proteins containing fluoride, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms were obtained from www.rcsb.org [1] using Biopython (module Bio.PDB) [2,3].  Entries with the best resolution were selected from alternative entries for the processing using biopandas[4].Halogen neighbors were identified within 5A, the distance from halogen to neighbor was also determined using biopandas.If halogen had more than one neighbor, then the angles were determined between halogen-nearest atom vector and the halogen-atom vector using numpy[5]. The accessable surface area of each halogen was determined using freesasa [6].
